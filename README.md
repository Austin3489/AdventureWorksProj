# AdventureWorksProj
Language used: Python in Jupyter Notebook <br>
This projects makes use of Microsoft SQL Server queries and python to illustrate and output data about the AdventureWorks2019 database, focusing on the employees and their information. It utilizes the pandas library to output data in Dataframe format. </br>

Currently, the project has functions that return the following... </br>

Names of employees in a given organization level </br></br>
All the salaries in the organization ordered by business entity id </br></br>
The amount a given employee makes </br></br>
A function that returns the annual pay rate history for a given job position or job field, showing the promotion opportunities. For instance, inputting "Sales Representative" will return the pay rate history for the position of Sales Representative, which generally would be less changing. However, entering "Sales" will search the database for all sales related jobs, including sales representative, and return on average what that job field made per year. An increase in pay indicates that higher ranking positions have opened up and more promotion opportunities have risen, along with more rates added. The trend graph indicates if the average pay rate is on an incline or decline.
